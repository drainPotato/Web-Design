# Web Design Week 3 Homework 1-5 #
Start working from the sample files ([week3-sample.html](https://github.com/jameswoo/jameswoo.github.io/blob/main/week3-sample.html)). 
Again, try to understand every single line of elements first, then only start working.

Sample 2: Using Background Image in CSS

There are five demo screenshots below. For each homework, you would need to follow EXACTLY as the screenshot: font size, color, images / background image, layout, spacing. Use this [color checker](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/) to check the color code.
For the font, since you haven't learned how to install Google font, just use 'Lato' for all homeworks (check my sample file to see how I install and use them)

Put all your html files under "homework" folder under "week3" folder:
## Homework 1 (homework1.html) ##
