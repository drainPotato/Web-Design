                    <p>Aircraft</p>
                    <img src="image/Hydra.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>The Hydra is suggestively based on the British Aerospace Harrier II (formerly known as the Hawker
                        Siddley Harrier), a well-known British fighter jet with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL)
                        capabilities, with minor detailing from the F-16 Fighting Falcon, such as the cockpit and air
                        intake. The Harrier's influence is further proven by the cheat code that is used to spawn the
                        jet in the PC version: "Jumpjet", which is a nickname for Harrier jets.

                    <h1>P-996 Lazer</h1>
                    <p>Aircraft</p>
                    <img src="image/P996LAZER.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>The design of the P-996 LAZER is mainly derived from the F-16C Fighting Falcon, evidenced by the
                        entire fuselage, from the nose to the rear, with the two rear downward vertical tail fins,
                        cockpit (with side-mounted control stick), landing gears (main and nose) and wings. The air
                        intake is also derived from the aforementioned aircraft, albeit split into two separate intakes,
                        similar to a Eurofighter Typhoon. Its forward swinging canopy (with zig zag canopy detonation
                        cord), twin vertical stabilizers and horizontal stabilizers are derived from the Lockheed Martin
                        F-35 and X-35. Unlike the F-16, which has only one cannon mounted on the port side, the P-996
                        LAZER has dual cannons on each side, similar to fighter jets such as the F-20 Tigershark. The
                        Lazer is depicted as carrier-capable, which could possibly be a homage to the Vought model 1600,
                        the carrier-capable version of the F-16.</p>
