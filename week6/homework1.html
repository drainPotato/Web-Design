            <div>Warstock Cache & Carry is a business that sells military and utility equipment, vehicles, and more. The
                player can buy their products off their website.
                <br><br>
                They sell off-road vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and helicopters. Aside from their standard military
                equipment, they also sell heavy-duty vehicles such as the Airport Bus, Bus, Mule and the Journey (which
                defies the purpose of the website).
                <br><br>
                It is possible that they are distributing the military gear illegally, as it seems that any citizen can
                buy their products, including the Rhino Tank (as implied by its tagline).

                Whether you're a private security company, paramilitary force, rebel militia, hot housewife, radical
                insurgent, unhinged lottery winner, over-zealous neighborhood watch group, or just a military hobbyist
                with a worrying amount of disposable income, we've got you covered.
