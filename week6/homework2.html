                Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science
                spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to
                applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Though
                more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer
                programming.
                <br><br>
                Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation concerns
                abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields
                of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for
                preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation
                of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and
                database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human-computer interaction investigates
                the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the
                design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded
                systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes
                the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and
                machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making,
                environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial
                intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural
                language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
                <br><br>
                The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be
                automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in
                computer science.

            <div>Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. It involves
                working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory.
                Computer scientists define the computational principles that are the basis of all software.
